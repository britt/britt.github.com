We’ll be talking a behavior that we find annoying or want to try and control, like whining, and I will say, “Well it’s a strategy that he’s learned to get a treat.” Dara will counter, “He’s 5 years old. Five year olds don’t think like that. They’re not manipulative like that.” <em>This echoes an argument that we often have with my mother and other people of her generation that who seem to think of babies and children as manipulative little schemers.</em> I think there’s some truth to this but I don’t think they are intentionally manipulative. Intention is the difference. No matter how many times we have this conversation I end up explaining, “I don’t mean that he’s making a plan to deceive you into getting a cookie. I mean that he’s learned by stimulus and response that if he does this he’ll get a cookie. The process is unconscious.”</p>
<p>I think there are a great many people, my wife included, who model people as having only conscious thought processes. I think intellectually they understand the idea of the unconscious but their everyday model of people only includes conscious cognition. It seems to extend to perceptions of systems as well. There are people who see a racist system (on with racist outcomes) and conclude that it must have been planned to institute oppression. Sometimes that’s true, FHA red-lining being a good example, but sometimes it’s not.</p>
