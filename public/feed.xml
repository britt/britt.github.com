The author presents a view that much &#x27;splaining that goes on is a mismatch in communication styles. She defines two styles one based on social status and one based on information sharing. Much &#x27;splaining is due to one party communicating in a social status style and the other in an information sharing style. The explanation of New Yorker communication style is a very good example. This seems right but she ignores that the bird website (I love this nickname) has a large population of dishonest sea lions and trolls and they mix freely enough with the rest of the population that a lot of genuine &#x27;splaining is going on and it&#x27;s very hard to tell non-mailicious &#x27;splaining from malicious &#x27;splaining. The examples she uses are also fairly innocuous and not very emotionally charged. The stakes are fairly low when correcting someone about UNIX history, as opposed to say racism. UNIX history doesn&#x27;t really touch on a priceless value. Also, she seems blind to the status games that are played with the community of information sharers. They are different, but they are there and the assertion that information sharing status games are not zero sum is complete bullshit. Information sharers just can have different kinds of arguments without affecting status.</section></article></li><li><article class="reading-note"><a href="http://www.alternet.org/education/why-are-k-12-school-leaders-being-trained-coercive-interrogation-techniques" class="title" target="_blank">Why Are K-12 School Leaders Being Trained in Coercive Interrogation Techniques?</a><summary class="description">One of America’s great paradoxes (or perhaps hypocrisies) is its claim to be a global beacon of freedom, even as it jails more of its citizens —by population…</summary><section class="my-notes">*facepalm*</section></article></li></ol></section><section><h3><time datetime="2016-04-15" class="date-read">Friday</time></h3><ol class="reading-notes-list"><li><article class="reading-note"><a href="http://www.the-tls.co.uk/tls/public/article1686963.ece" class="title" target="_blank">Christopher Hitchens, from dove to hawk | TLS</a><summary class="description">Christopher Hitchens, from dove to hawk GEOFFREY WHEATCROFT Christopher Hitchens AND YET . . . 352pp. Atlantic. £20. 978 1 782 39457 0 US: Simon and Schuster.…</summary><section class="my-notes">Hitchens was a better stylist and performer than thinker.

The worst blindness is not where your map is wrong but the aspects it does not even consider and cannot accommodate. One interpretation of Fingerspitzengefuhl, finger tip feeling, is an intuitive understanding of breaks in your own and others maps. With it you can see the breaks in others maps. This jives with my own belief that you get a lot of advantage by paying attention and being observant. Many people seem to navigate by maps only. They also don&#x27;t seem to pay enough attention to actually notice when their map is wrong. Try talking to an accountant about how your business is doing.

The majority of that film’s interest, I’d suggest, comes precisely through its depiction of architectural space: John McClane, a New York cop on his Christmas vacation, moves through a Los Angeles high-rise in basically every conceivable way but passing through its doors and hallways. McClane explores the tower—called Nakatomi Plaza—via elevator shafts and air ducts, crashing through windows from the outside-in and shooting open the locks of rooftop doorways.

It presents one of the best explanations of smooth vs. striated space (Deleuze &amp; Guattari). Think of the way a taxi driver drives, ignoring lanes, cutting through parking lots, making right turns from the left lane. Most drivers see the road as a divided group of lanes with rules and restrictions. The cabbie sees it as it is, a single piece of smooth asphalt, and treats it as such.</section></article></li><li><article class="reading-note"><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/florida-civil-asset-forfeiture_us_56fe9d7ce4b0a06d5805896d" class="title" target="_blank">Florida Just Made It Harder For Police To Take People&#x27;s Stuff</a><summary class="description">bjdlzx via Getty Images A new Florida law will rein in a controversial practice critics call &quot;policing for profit.&quot; Florida Gov.

This provides an interesting way to classify AI, potentially more interesting than the Turing test. An AI is a general purpose AI (AGI) if it can play human complete infinite games.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There is an argument that I frequently have with my wife Dara about our children. We’ll be talking a behavior that we find annoying or want to try and control, like whining, and I will say, “Well it’s a strategy that he’s learned to get a treat.” Dara will counter, “He’s 5 years old. Five year olds don’t think like that. They’re not manipulative like that.” <em>This echoes an argument that we often have with my mother and other people of her generation that who seem to think of babies and children as manipulative little schemers.</em> I think there’s some truth to this but I don’t think they are intentionally manipulative. Intention is the difference. No matter how many times we have this conversation I end up explaining, “I don’t mean that he’s making a plan to deceive you into getting a cookie. I mean that he’s learned by stimulus and response that if he does this he’ll get a cookie. The process is unconscious.”</p>
<p>I think there are a great many people, my wife included, who model people as having only conscious thought processes. I think intellectually they understand the idea of the unconscious but their everyday model of people only includes conscious cognition. It seems to extend to perceptions of systems as well. There are people who see a racist system (on with racist outcomes) and conclude that it must have been planned to institute oppression. Sometimes that’s true, FHA red-lining being a good example, but sometimes it’s not.</p>
