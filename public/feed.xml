        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>Slightly Sour Strawberry Smash</h2>
<p>A strawberry old fashioned with a sweet and sour taste. The walnut cordial is somewhat sour and balances the sweetness and fruitiness of the strawberry much like balsamic vinegar in a strawberry salad. Sounds weird. Tastes great. Right click and <a href="#highball-import">save the image</a> to import into <a href="http://www.studioneat.com/products/highball">Highball</a>.</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
<li>2oz Bourbon <em>(I usually use <a href="http://www.buffalotrace.com/">Buffalo Trace</a>)</em></li>
<li>1/4oz Simple or Maple Syrup</li>
<li>1/4oz Black Walnut Cordial</li>
<li>2 dashes of Angostura bitters</li>
<li>1 strawberry</li>
</ul>
<p>Pour the bourbon, bitters, walnut cordial, and syrup into a mixing glass. Slice the strawberry into thin slices. Macerate half of the strawberry in the liquor. Save the rest for a garnish. Add ice and stir gently. Strain and serve in a tumbler with a large ice cube. Garnish with the remaining strawberry.</p>
