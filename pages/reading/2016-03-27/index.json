In an environment of low uncertainty, like the baby boomers grew up in, there were few alternatives but it was easy to choose between good and bad moves. Now there are many options and it's hard to tell which is which. So, instead of picking the best of few options we must eliminate the obviously bad choices and muddle through as best we can."},{"date_liked":"March 28, 2016 at 10:32PM","title":"Follow the money: Apple vs. the FBI - Charlie's Diary","description":"A lot of people are watching the spectacle of Apple vs. the FBI and the Homeland Security Theatre and rubbing their eyes, wondering why Apple (in the person of…","url":"http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2016/03/follow-the-money-apple-vs-the-.html","notes":"Charlie Stross argues that Apple is fighting FBI because it wants to become a bank. What else are they going to do with their massive cash stockpile? Installing a backdoor on every iphone as the FBI is requesting would undermine customers' trust in them as a bank, and rightly so. I think that is an interesting but dubious theory. The kernel of it may be correct though. I don't know if they want to become a bank but they are a payments processor. A universal backdoor would make me much less likely to trust them with my payment information."},{"date_liked":"March 29, 2016 at 09:11AM","title":"reactjs/react-basic","description":"React - Basic Theoretical Concepts This document is my attempt to formally explain my mental model of React.

These standards are extrememly forgiving. While it seems reasonable to offer a police officer the benefit of the doubt when making what is potentially a life or death decision, the standard set is so loose that it is almost  impossible to convict a cop of excessive use of force. Worse, since those cases police have been trained how to report their use of force to make it seem as though they are in danger."}]}
