## Slightly Sour Strawberry Smash

A strawberry old fashioned with a sweet and sour taste. The walnut cordial is somewhat sour and balances the sweetness and fruitiness of the strawberry much like balsamic vinegar in a strawberry salad. Sounds weird. Tastes great.

### Ingredients

* 2oz Bourbon _(I usually use [Buffalo Trace](http://www.buffalotrace.com/))_
* 1/4oz Simple or Maple Syrup
* 1/4oz Black Walnut Cordial
* 2 dashes of Angostura bitters
* 1 strawberry

Pour the bourbon, bitters, walnut cordial, and syrup into a mixing glass. Slice the strawberry into thin slices. Macerate half of the strawberry in the liquor. Save the rest for a garnish. Add ice and stir gently. Strain and serve in a tumbler with a large ice cube. Garnish with the remaining strawberry.
