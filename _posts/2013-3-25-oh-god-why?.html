title: Oh God Why?
---

One afternoon I noticed that <a href="http://brittcrawford.com" title="My name as a domain">brittcrawford.com</a> was available for purchase for the first time in a number of years. This all happened not too long after I'd been to <a href="http://refactorcamp.org/" title="Refactor Camp">a gathering of really smart people</a> most of whom had <div class="dropdown inline">
  <a class="dropdown-toggle" data-toggle="dropdown" id="dLabel" href="#">blogs</a>
  <ul class="dropdown-menu" role="menu" aria-labelledby="dLabel">
    <li><a tabindex="-1" href="http://ribbonfarm.com/">Ribbonfarm</a></li>
    <li><a tabindex="-1" href="http://qaboom.com/">Qaboom</a></li>
    <li><a tabindex="-1" href="http://onthespiral.com/">On the Spiral</a></li>
    <li><a tabindex="-1" href="http://akkartik.name/">Kartik Agaram</a></li>
  </ul>
</div>. I thought to myself <em>"This is a good opportunity to start writing."</em> And now here you are in 2015 looking at another abandoned vanity site with four posts on it.
