title: The Power of Habit
---

**[The Power of Habit](http://www.amazon.com/The-Power-Habit-What-Business/dp/1400069289/) is an awful book that contains some very useful information.** The book is put together in the style of a bad Discovery Channel documentary, multiple narratives chopped up and interspersed with bits of explication. I can even hear the faux-documentary narration in my head as I read. Worse, the entire book could have been 30 pages long. It would have made a very useful pamphlet. After the main concepts are explained it turns into a laundry list of anecdotes. Things might have picked up in the third section, *Habits in Society*, but I never made it there. Now that I'm done griping here are the three useful things I learned.

#### 1. The Habit Loop

Cue &raquo; Routine &raquo; Reward

* Explain the loop
* Reward stimulus precedes the actual reward
* Routine replacement 


#### 2. The Keystone Habit



#### 3. The Importance of Motivation



How to preventing relapse under stress
