title: The Power of Habit
---

I just finished reading [The Power of Habit](http://www.amazon.com/The-Power-Habit-What-Business/dp/1400069289/). **It's an awful book that contains some very useful information.** The writing is horrible and the whole book is put together in the style of a bad Discovery Channel documentary, multiple narratives chopped up and interspersed with bits of explication. Also, the entire book could have been 30 pages long. After the main concepts are explained it just repeats anecdote after anecdote. Things might have picked up in the third section, *Habits in Society*, but I never made it there. Now that I'm done griping here are the three useful things I learned.

### The Habit Loop
#### Cue &raquo; Routine &raquo; Reward

* Explain the loop
* Reward stimulus precedes the actual reward
* Routine replacement 

### The Keystone Habit

### The Importance of Motivation
#### Preventing relapse under stress
