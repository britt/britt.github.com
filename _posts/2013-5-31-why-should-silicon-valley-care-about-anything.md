title: Why Should Silicon Valley Care About Anything?
---

Today on [GigaOm](http://gigaom.com/) there was an article titled, [Silicon Valley is now paying even less attention to climate change and that sucks](http://gigaom.com/2013/05/31/silicon-valley-is-now-paying-even-less-attention-to-climate-change-and-that-sucks/). 

<blockquote cite="http://gigaom.com/2013/05/31/silicon-valley-is-now-paying-even-less-attention-to-climate-change-and-that-sucks/">
  Following the collapse of the first wave of cleantech investing, and an attention on digital technology, Silicon Valley has moved even further away from using tech to fight climate change. And that’s too bad.
</blockquote>

Whenever, I see articles like this I am initially sympathetic to the writer's point but always the same two questions leap angrily to my mind.


* Why should *Silicon Valley* care about anything?
* Why in the hell are you looking to them for answers anyway?


Because you've been led to believe that all problems are technical problems and that businesses are the only ones that can get anything done.[^1]
