<blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Scorpion_and_the_Frog">
  <p>
    Once upon a time the fox came upon a scorpion trying to cross the river. “You can ride on my head to the far shore”, said the fox, “but only on the condition you promise not to sting me.” “But see, that’s my nature”, said the scorpion, “to sting is my nature.”
  </p>
  <br/>
  <p>
    Surprise, surprise; halfway across the river, the scorpion jabbed his stinger right in the helpful fox’s head. “Now we’re both gonna die, you dumb old scorpion”, said the fox, “What do you want to go sting me for? I was doing you a good turn!”. 
  </p>
  <br/>
  <p>
    And the scorpion said, “I told you from the start… That’s my nature…”
