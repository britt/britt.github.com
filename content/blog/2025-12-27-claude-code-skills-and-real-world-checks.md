# Claude Code Skills And Real-World Checks

This site links to a separate repository called Claude Code Skills. That repository contains skills and CLAUDE.md templates for working with Claude Code.

The `avro-sqlite` project linked on this site notes that the entire package, including its documentation, is written by a language model. That is one example of using an AI system to write code and docs.

This page is a placeholder for a future description of how Claude Code Skills, tests, and real-world verification fit together in day-to-day development.
