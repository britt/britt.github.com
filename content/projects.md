## Home Cooked Software [^1]

These are things that I have built simply because I wanted them to exist, or in the case of **avro-sqlite**, because I wanted to see if I could.[^2] I like tools that serve me, not ones that try to extract value from me or my attention. I also like the [process of building and understanding](https://brucesterling.tumblr.com/post/749569601319452672/realistic-utopias-a-speech-by-bruce-sterling) the things that I use.

* [Readinglist.live](https://www.readinglist.live) - Turn any web page into a podcast episode, with decently human sounding voices. _(It just reads it to you in a nice human voice, no AI commentary or nonsense like that.)_
* [avro-sqlite](https://github.com/britt/avro-sqlite) - a Go package to read a SQLite database, extract the schema and data to [Apache Avro](https://avro.apache.org/) and vice versa

## Other Stuff
* [Cocktail Recipes](/cocktails/) - A small collection of cocktails that I've created.
* [We Could Be Heroes](/we_could_be_heroes.pdf) - ***This isn't rock n. roll. It's suicide!*** A one-page role playing game where every player is David Bowie.

## Abandoned but not forgotten
* [Havamal](https://smile.amazon.com/Snugglebear-Team-Company-Havamal/dp/B07N114BWY/ref=sr_1_2?keywords=havamal&qid=1550960415&s=digital-skills&sr=1-2-catcorr) - The wisdom of Odin, told by Alexa. Say, "Alexa tell me the wisdom of Odin."
* [Testivus](https://github.com/britt/testivus/) - _(inactive)_ A Go test helper library to let your code know how it disappoints you.
