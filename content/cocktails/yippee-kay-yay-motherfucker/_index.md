A spicy variant on the Old Fashioned, a tribute to [John McClane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McClane) and a terrible pun. Right click and [save the image](#highball-import) to import into [Highball](http://www.studioneat.com/products/highball).

### Ingredients

* 2oz Bourbon _(I use [Buffalo Trace](http://www.buffalotrace.com/))_
* 1/4oz Maple Syrup
* 1 dash of Cayenne Pepper
* 1 dash of Angostura bitters
* 1 twist of lemon

Gently stir the bourbon, maple syrup, bitters and cayenne with ice to chill. Be careful not to chip the ice and water down the drink. Serve on the rocks with a twist of lemon.
