### Ingredients

* 2 scoops of AG1
* 1 scoop of Organic Vanilla Whey Protein Powder
* 16 oz. of Water

_The picture says ounces, but that's just because Highball doesn't have scoops as a unit of measure._

Combine the dry ingredients in a bowl. Whisk them together. Then slowly add in the water, whisking as you go like you are making a roux.
