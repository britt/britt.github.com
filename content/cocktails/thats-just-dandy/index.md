Named after the first words to come out of my mouth after tasting it. We bought tons of apricots this Summer and now have tons of apricot jam, and I was searching for something to do with it. 

### Ingredients

* 2oz Bourbon
* Juice of 1/2 a Lemon
* 2 TBSP Apricot Preserves
* 1/4oz Simple syrup
* 2 dashes of Angostura
* 1 Sprig of Mint

Combine ingredients in a shaker with ice. Shake gently. Strain and serve on the rocks. Garnish with a sprig of mint.
