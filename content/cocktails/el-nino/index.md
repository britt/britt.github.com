This is the one cocktail in the collection that I didn't create. My friend [Josh Kelly](https://twitter.com/jcoltkelly) devised this recipe, and on a trip to the beach after many iterations we pronounced it good. 

### Ingredients

* 1oz Tequila
* 1oz Pear liqueur
* 1/2 oz Lime juice
* 1/4oz Allspice dram
* 1/4oz Simple syrup
* 1 dash grapefruit bitters
* 1 twist of lime

Combine ingredients in a shaker with ice. Shake vigorously. Strain into a coupe glass. Garnish with a twist of lime.
