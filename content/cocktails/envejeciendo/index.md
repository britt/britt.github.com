When I was young I thought only old people like grapefruit. Then I started to like it and decided I was old. This combines grapefruit, Mezcal, and bit of spice. It's delightful to drink while watching [Slow Horses](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/slow_horses).

### Ingredients

* 2oz Mezcal
* 2oz Grapefruit Juice
* 1/2oz Orange liqueur
* 1/2oz Maple Syrup
* 1/2oz Lime juice
* 1 pinch Tajin
* 1 pinch Cayenne
* 1 dash orange bitters
* 1 dash floral bitters
* 1 slice of lime

Combine ingredients in a shaker with ice. Shake gently. Strain into a glass over a large rock. Garnish with a slice of lime.
