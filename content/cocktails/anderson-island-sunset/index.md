This cocktail was born from the age old question, "What do we have?". I was staying at a cabin on Anderson island with family. A lot of were packed in. I was sleeping in my van, and there were tents set up in the yard. My sister Katie, my cousins Jon and Alyssa, and I foraged through the kitchen and created a cocktail to commermorate the occasion, and get us ready to go to the concert of a *13 piece Huey Lewis cover band who's name I cant remember* 🤷‍♂️

### Ingredients

* 2oz Tequila
* 1oz Guava Nectar
* 1oz Sparkling Water
* 1 dash Margarita Mix
* 1 pinch of Mint
* Some (enough) Frozen Blueberrries

Combine the guava nectar, sparkling water, and margarita mix and pour them into margarita glass. Drop in the blueberries. Float the tequila on top and garnish with a sprig of mint.
