A Negroni's neurotic cousin who moved to the suburbs, got a soda maker, and now won't shut up about "balance" while still being fundamentally unhinged.

* 1 ½ oz CAMPARI  
* 1 ½ oz SWEET VERMOUTH  
* 1 SODA WATER  
* 1 ORANGE WEDGE  
* 1 SLICE OF ORANGE PEEL  
* 1 DASH ORANGE BITTERS  

Muddle the orange slice in a shaker. Add the Campari, vermouth, bitters, and some ice. Shake vigorously and strain into a rocks glass with ice. Top with a splash of soda water and garnish with the slice of orange peel.
