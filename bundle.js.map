Much 'splaining is due to one party communicating in a social status style and the other in an information sharing style. The explanation of New Yorker communication style is a very good example. This seems right but she ignores that the bird website (I love this nickname) has a large population of dishonest sea lions and trolls and they mix freely enough with the rest of the population that a lot of genuine 'splaining is going on and it's very hard to tell non-mailicious 'splaining from malicious 'splaining.

UNIX history doesn't really touch on a priceless value. Also, she seems blind to the status games that are played with the community of information sharers. They are different, but they are there and the assertion that information sharing status games are not zero sum is complete bullshit.

The author presents a view that much 'splaining that goes on is a mismatch in communication styles. She defines two styles one based on social status and one based on information sharing. Much 'splaining is due to one party communicating in a social status style and the other in an information sharing style. The explanation of New Yorker communication style is a very good example. This seems right but she ignores that the bird website (I love this nickname) has a large population of dishonest sea lions and trolls and they mix freely enough with the rest of the population that a lot of genuine 'splaining is going on and it's very hard to tell non-mailicious 'splaining from malicious 'splaining. The examples she uses are also fairly innocuous and not very emotionally charged. The stakes are fairly low when correcting someone about UNIX history, as opposed to say racism. UNIX history doesn't really touch on a priceless value. Also, she seems blind to the status games that are played with the community of information sharers. They are different, but they are there and the assertion that information sharing status games are not zero sum is complete bullshit. Information sharers just can have different kinds of arguments without affecting status.\"\n\t\t}\n\t]\n};\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./reading/2016-04-10/index.json\n ** module id = 379\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","import React from 'react'\nimport Headline from 'components/headline'\nimport Icon from 'components/icon'\nimport DocumentTitle from 'react-document-title'\nimport moment from 'moment'\nimport 'css/gutenberg/src/style/gutenberg.scss'\nimport { Pages } from 'lib/sort_utils'\nimport { config } from 'config'\nimport PageUtils from 'lib/page_utils'\n\nconst WeekLink = ({page}) => {\n  return (\n    <li>\n      <a href={page.path}>{page.data.week}</a>&nbsp;\n      &mdash; {page.data.articles.length} articles\n    </li>\n  )\n}\n\nexport default ({route}) => {\n  const pages = route.pages.filter((page) => PageUtils.isReadingPage(page.path))\n  const links = pages.sort(Pages.dateInPath).reverse().map((page) => <WeekLink page={page} />)\n\n  return (\n    <DocumentTitle title={\"Reading Notes - \" + config.siteTitle }>\n      <main className=\"reading-notes\">\n        <h2>\n          Reading Notes\n        </h2>\n        <p>\n          A short description and notes for articles I read and liked.
