## Sharable typography configurations
You can use the Typography.js playground to design your perfect
typography setup. If you come up with a really good one, share it with
the community! We're collecting configurations [in this
issue](https://github.com/KyleAMathews/typography.js/issues/10).

## Why
Typography is a dash of design sense and a cup full of math. Math that's
tedious and hard to do right in CSS.

Typography.js provides a declarative way to define your typography.
Changing your fonts or base font size shouldn't be hard. With Typography.js it isn't.

## Vertical Rhythm
Grids make spatial world orderly

Most web designers and developers are familiar with __horizontal__ grids
such as 960 or Susy or Bootstrap.

The tools in this package helps you setup and maintain your vertical grid.

CSS doesn't make this easy.
