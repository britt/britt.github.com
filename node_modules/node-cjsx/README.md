node-cjsx
=========

Transparently `require()` cjsx from node

### Usage

`require('node-cjsx').transform()`

`node-cjsx` is activated for files with either `.cjsx` or `.coffee` extension.

### Installation
```bash
npm install node-cjsx
```

### Thanks
This package is inspired by [node-jsx](https://github.com/petehunt/node-jsx) and use [coffee-react-transform](https://github.com/jsdf/coffee-react-transform) to handle `cjsx` transformation to `CoffeeScript`.
Thanks to the authors for their great work.
