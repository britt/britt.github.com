She defines two styles one based on social status and one based on information sharing. Much 'splaining is due to one party communicating in a social status style and the other in an information sharing style. The explanation of New Yorker communication style is a very good example. This seems right but she ignores that the bird website (I love this nickname) has a large population of dishonest sea lions and trolls and they mix freely enough with the rest of the population that a lot of genuine 'splaining is going on and it's very hard to tell non-mailicious 'splaining from malicious 'splaining. The examples she uses are also fairly innocuous and not very emotionally charged. The stakes are fairly low when correcting someone about UNIX history, as opposed to say racism. UNIX history doesn't really touch on a priceless value. Also, she seems blind to the status games that are played with the community of information sharers. They are different, but they are there and the assertion that information sharing status games are not zero sum is complete bullshit. Information sharers just can have different kinds of arguments without affecting status."

The worst blindness is not where your map is wrong but the aspects it does not even consider and cannot accommodate. One interpretation of Fingerspitzengefuhl, finger tip feeling, is an intuitive understanding of breaks in your own and others maps. With it you can see the breaks in others maps. This jives with my own belief that you get a lot of advantage by paying attention and being observant. Many people seem to navigate by maps only. They also don't seem to pay enough attention to actually notice when their map is wrong. Try talking to an accountant about how your business is doing. You'll see what I mean."

The majority of that film’s interest, I’d suggest, comes precisely through its depiction of architectural space: John McClane, a New York cop on his Christmas vacation, moves through a Los Angeles high-rise in basically every conceivable way but passing through its doors and hallways. McClane explores the tower—called Nakatomi Plaza—via elevator shafts and air ducts, crashing through windows from the outside-in and shooting open the locks of rooftop doorways. If there is not a corridor, he makes one; if there is not an opening, there will be soon.",

Think of the way a taxi driver drives, ignoring lanes, cutting through parking lots, making right turns from the left lane. Most drivers see the road as a divided group of lanes with rules and restrictions. The cabbie sees it as it is, a single piece of smooth asphalt, and treats it as such."

Then buy speed to market and scale. If you don't buy all four you will fail.
