The author presents a view that much 'splaining that goes on is a mismatch in communication styles. She defines two styles one based on social status and one based on information sharing. Much 'splaining is due to one party communicating in a social status style and the other in an information sharing style. The explanation of New Yorker communication style is a very good example. This seems right but she ignores that the bird website (I love this nickname) has a large population of dishonest sea lions and trolls and they mix freely enough with the rest of the population that a lot of genuine 'splaining is going on and it's very hard to tell non-mailicious 'splaining from malicious 'splaining. The examples she uses are also fairly innocuous and not very emotionally charged. The stakes are fairly low when correcting someone about UNIX history, as opposed to say racism. UNIX history doesn't really touch on a priceless value. Also, she seems blind to the status games that are played with the community of information sharers. They are different, but they are there and the assertion that information sharing status games are not zero sum is complete bullshit. Information sharers just can have different kinds of arguments without affecting status."},{"title":"Why Are K-12 School Leaders Being Trained in Coercive Interrogation Techniques?","date_liked":"April 14, 2016 at 05:54PM","description":"One of America’s great paradoxes (or perhaps hypocrisies) is its claim to be a global beacon of freedom, even as it jails more of its citizens —by population…","url":"http://www.alternet.org/education/why-are-k-12-school-leaders-being-trained-coercive-interrogation-techniques","notes":"*facepalm*"},{"title":"Christopher Hitchens, from dove to hawk | TLS","date_liked":"April 15, 2016 at 09:22AM","description":"Christopher Hitchens, from dove to hawk GEOFFREY WHEATCROFT Christopher Hitchens AND YET . . . 352pp. Atlantic. £20. 978 1 782 39457 0 US: Simon and Schuster.…","url":"http://www.the-tls.co.uk/tls/public/article1686963.ece","notes":"Hitchens was a better stylist and performer than thinker.
